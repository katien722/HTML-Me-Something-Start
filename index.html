            <h3 id=".funParagraph">Why Self-Care is Important...and Care-Stacking</h3>
            <p>Today I meditated, made my bed and danced to <em>two</em> songs before I brushed my teeth. These things are so important for my personal self-care plan. </p>
            <p>
               I have realized the importance of focusing on the little ways to take care of myself so that 
               I bring the best version of myself to all that I do on a daily basis. The way that I care 
               for myself effects all aspects of my life, kind of like a game of Jenga.</p>
               
              <p> I don't know which piece (or element of self-care, in this analogy) is going to 
               cause the tower to fall (self to break-down), so I need to keep all pieces in 50-ways-to-practice-self-care
               for a strong foundation. And, just like in a game of Jenga, balance is key.</p>
               

              <p> Balancing all parts of myself includes making sure that I tend to the physical, social, and emotional 
               aspects of myself. Physically, I need to make sure that I feed and fuel my body effectively
               and use the gift of mobility that I am blessed with. Socially, I need to ensure positive
               interactions with my peers, because healthy connection with others contributes to my well-being.</p>
                
               Emotionally, I need to give myself opportunities to express my feelings, rest when needed, and 
               take time to assess and regulate my emotions so that I may approach each situation, opportunity,
               and obstacle that presents itself efficiently and with a clear mind. 

               What is care-stacking? I think I made up this term, but to me, it is a way to maximize my self-care 
               habits. For example, making delicious and nutritious meals checks the boxes for creative expression (emotional need),
               nutrient-dense food (physical need), and sharing my creations with friends (social need)...I have 
               stacked my self-care with one act that fulfills me in three aspects.
